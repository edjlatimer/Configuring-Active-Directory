</p>  

##  Overview  
This project demonstrates how to prepare the proper infrastructure to successfully deploy and configure an **Active Directory environment** using Microsoft Azure.  

The setup includes:  
- A **Domain Controller** (Windows Server 2022)  
- A **Client Machine** (Windows 10)  
- Proper **network, DNS, and connectivity settings** to enable AD functionality  

---

##  Technologies Used  
- **Microsoft Azure** (Resource Groups, Virtual Networks, Virtual Machines)  
- **Windows Server 2022** (Domain Controller)  
- **Windows 10 (21H2)** (Client Machine)  
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**  
- **PowerShell** & **Remote Desktop**  

---

##  Step-by-Step Implementation  

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Create Resource Group & Virtual Network  
- Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  
- Create a **Resource Group**:  
  - Search for *Resource Groups* â†’ Click **Create** â†’ Enter name (e.g., `Active-Directory-Lab`).  
- Create a **Virtual Network (VNet)**:  
  - Search for *Virtual Networks* â†’ Click **Create** â†’ Choose the `Active-Directory-Lab` resource group.  
  - Name it `Active-Directory-VNet`.  
  - The **Subnet** could be left at the default setting.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Deploy the Domain Controller (DC-1)    
- Create a Virtual Machine:  
  - Virtual Machine Name: `DC-1`
  - Resource Group: `Active-Directory-Lab`
  - Virtual Network: `Active-Directory-VNet`
  - Region: `(Same Region as Resource Group & VNet)`
  - Image: `Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition - Gen2`
  - Size: `Standard D2s v3 (2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory)`
  - Username: `labuser`  
  - Password: `*********`

---

- Configure **Dc-1 Private IP Address From Dynamic To Static Private IP**:  
  - Go to `DC-1` â†’ Networking â†’ NIC settings â†’ Change IP from *Dynamic* to *Static*.

---

- Connect to `DC-1` VM with **Remote Desktop**.  
- Inside the `DC-1` VM: You should be brought to a `Server Manager Dashbroad`
  (That'll confirm you have successfully setup your DC-1 Server correctly)
- Now, Open **Windows Defender Firewall** from Start menu 
  - Within **Windows Defender Firewall Properties** ensure that **Firewall state** for:
    - Domain Profile
    - Private Profile
    - Public Profile

   are ALL set to **Off** (temporarily to simplify connectivity testing)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Deploy the Client Machine (Client-1)  
 
- Create a Virtual Machine:  
  - Virtual Machine Name: `Client-1`
  - Resource Group: `Active-Directory-Lab`
  - Virtual Network: `Active-Directory-VNet`
  - Region: `(Same Region as Resource Group & VNet)`
  - Image: `Windows (Windows 10 Pro)`
  - Size: `Standard D2s v3 (2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory)`
  - Username: `labuser`  
  - Password: `*********`

---

- Update **DNS settings**:  
  - Go to `Client-1` â†’ Networking â†’ DNS Servers â†’ Set to **Custom DNS** â†’ Put `DC-1`â€™s private IP (`10.0.0.4` for the sake of this project) 
  - Save and **Restart** the `Client-1` VM within Azure  
- Then connect and log into `Client-1` VM with **Remote Desktop**

**Note:** It'll bring you to a Windows OS Home Screen (Not a **`Server Manager Dashbroad`**) once logged in = Successful Windows 10 deployment

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Verify Connectivity Between Client and DC Using Powershell

- On `Client-1`, open **Powershell**:  
  - Run **`Ping` DC-1 Private IP `(10.0.0.4)`**
      
  - Confirm replies are received.  

- On `Client-1`, open **PowerShell**:  
  - Run **ipconfig /all**
  - Verify the **DNS Server** is set to `DC-1`â€™s Private IP

##  Outcome / Learnings  
By completing this project, I:  
- Prepared a fully functional **Active Directory Infrastructure** using Azure  
- Configured **static IP addressing** and custom DNS settings.  
- Validated communication between a **Domain Controller and client machine**.  
- Strengthen skills in **networking, VM management, and directory services**.
